									<p class="wraptext">Heyo, my name is David and I'm an uncomplicated person with a calm personality. Currently a 2nd year Master's student in Game development with a passion for level design and everything that's considered "epic". When I'm doing things for my self-improvement I workout or go on a hike or I spend hours at home learning about game development. My current biggest interest in game development is level design, but I also enjoy programming and game designing.</p>
									<p class="wraptext">My biggest interests are games and food, I spend most of my time either playing games or watching a food show. I enjoy games that can be played with friends as well as games that scratch that quick growth and reward itch(rogue-like games) that some of us have sometimes.</p>
									<p class="wraptext">As of now I do not have a lot of real work experience, it is something I'm eagerly working towards getting! c:</p>

								<p>I made this game together with six other devs during the Global Game Jam 2022. The theme for the game jam was duality and that is why we created a game in which the player can look into an alternate world.
								<p>The game revolves around collecting cat statues in order to revive a cat you've lost in the past. These statues can only be seen while looking into the alternate world, unfortunately for you it seems like you are not alone there...</p>

								<img class="leftWrap" src="images/CatEye2.PNG" width="530" height="350" alt="" />
								<h2>Design thoughts:</h2>
								<p>Initial idea was to create a thick spooky forest with some recognizable landmarks put around the map.<br>

									This was not fully realised due to performance issues and the density of the forest had to be cut down significantly.<br>
									
									To compensate for the empty spaces a lot of bulky assets were placed around to fill up the space.<br>
								</p>
									
									<p>I'm the most satisfied with the cat paw landmark. It's a rock formation that resembles a cats paw, I stumbled upon this idea while playing around with our boulder prefabs and thought that it fits the premise and the atmosphere perfectly.</p>
									<p><b>October 2022 Update:</b> I've gone back to the project to investigate the performance issues after getting a tip about what the cause may be.<br>
									After fiddling with shadow settings, changing to the Deferred Shading and baking the lightmaps the performance increased by almost 50%!<br>
									Note to self: Always try the game with shadows disabled when investigating performance issues c:</p>

							<h2 class="major">Unreal Engine 5 Project - The Foundry</h2>
							<img class="rightWrap" src="images/Foundry1.PNG" width="500" height="550" alt="" />
							<p>
								This was a hobby project I have worked on for a month whenever I had time. The goal was to practice <b>Greyboxing</b> and <b>Unreal Engine 5.</b><br>
								I've created an <b>FPS</b> level meant for a <b>Capture-The-Flag</b> gamemode, the level is inspired by games like Valorant and CSGO. In my design I assume that the players are able to use grenades or abilities to smoke off areas.<br>
								I'm a huge fan of sniping and lurking in FPS games and so I've designed a map that tries to focus on those elements, to keep things interesting I've added some <b>verticality</b> to the level. The general design of the map is that it is split into three main areas: <b>Mid</b>, <b>Parking</b> and <b>Office</b>.

							</p>
							
							
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundrySpawn.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>The Flag Zones are located directly opposite of each other and are very similar in strucutre, only difference being some of the obstacles are in different spots.<br>
							I wanted to create an asymmetrical level but I still wanted the core area to have some resemblence to each other.</p>
							
							<img class="rightWrap" src="images/FoundryMidBoiler.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>
								Mid is designed in a way that allows the snipers to really lockdown the areas that allow fast access to the flag zones. It is deliberately open and is meant to be a high risk high reward section of the map.<br>
								Directly opposite of each other are two what I like to call Boiler rooms that provide the snipers with some cover and a good outlook on the Mid section.
							</p>
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundryMid.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>
								Since the Mid section is sandwiched between the Parking and the Office I've added connectors that allow the players to go between the sections.<br>
								One of the connectors is located on the Balcony which can be reached either through the Office or by using stairs on the opposite ends of each other.<br>
								Below the Balcony there is an alcove Under that provides some cover to players that want to push Mid. 
							</p>
							<img class="rightWrap" src="images/FoundryMidStairs.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundryTopMid.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>The Top section of Mid can be reached by stairs from both sides of the map. <br>
							To cross over to the other side of Top the players would need to go across the Bridge which is the most open section of the map.</p>
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundryPreOffice.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>Both the Parking and the Office section have a little area that connects them to spawns, these serve as connecting blocks between the main section of the map.</p>
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundryOffice2.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>The Office is meant to be the main close-quarters section of the map, there are a lot of corners to watch out for as well as a few spots players can jump up on to get a better overview. <br>
							The lighting in the Office is meant to be a cold opposite to the warmth of the Tunnel. I always imagine offices being lit up by a white-blueish light. This gave me an opportunity to fiddle with Post-Processing.</p>
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundryNukeTown.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>The Parking section of the map is inspired by the classic map Nuke Town. Two buildings opposite of each other with a large obstacle(car) in the middle for some cover and a smaller obstacle on the side. <br>
							This section of the map is deliberately done in a simple way due to the complexity of the Office section. I did not want the map to be overly complex.</p>
							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/FoundryTunnel.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>The Tunnel offers a fast way across Mid, hidden from the snipers but it is a very compact section meaning that if a player would be caught running across they would be very exposed.</p>

							<img class="leftWrap" src="images/DungeonCrawl1.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>Latest work date: 17/09/2022 | Aprox. dev time: 35 hours</p>
							<p>This is a game I'm working on by myself during my free-time. It's done fully in Unity. The goal for this game is to serve as a learning step in my game dev journey. I get to practice the editor and learn new things.</p>

								<p>I want this game to play like a rogue-like dungeon crawling game except that a player can leave an instance early to keep their current loot<br>(see "Escape from Tarkov")</p>
							<h2>What I've done:</h2>
							<img class="rightWrap" src="images/DungeonCrawl2.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<p>​- Simple movement system<br>

								- UI and HUD<br>
								
								- Animations<br>
								
								- Enemy behaviour<br>
								
								- Combat system<br>
								
								- Collision system<br>
								
								- Data retention between scenes<br>
								
								- Leveling & weapon upgrading system<br>
								
								- In-game currency and experience points<br>
								
								- Level design for Floor 1<br>
								
								- Interactables in the level<br>
								
								- Floating text system</p>
								<img class="leftWrap" src="images/DungeonCrawl3.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
							<h2>Future plans:</h2>
							
							<p>- Rework the combat system (see "20 Minutes till Dawn")<br>

								- Add more content (Mobs, characters, weapons, interactables)<br>
								
								- Try out shaders and lighting<br>
								
								- Add skills/magic<br>
								
								- Add more floors<br>
								
								- more to come...</p>
